/* A css module file is converted to compiled css file where each class of css modulefile is converted as 
such as being described using the file name, class name and an offset number .
This is done by the css modules compiler which also creates a javascript file for the same with objects.

A CSS Module is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.

CSS Modules let you write styles in CSS files but consume them as JavaScript objects for additional processing 
and safety. CSS Modules are very popular because they automatically make class and animation names unique so
you donâ€™t have to worry about selector name collisions.

In this example the same div object is repeated all with the same classname ..but upon using css module files
we are having all these div as instances or objectsof class each with a unique name identified in the format 
of file name, class name, and an offset number which varies for every object. */
